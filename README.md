# RayTracer
C++ Raytracer done with the eigen library.<br>
This project was made as part of Concordia's Computer Graphics course.

This repository only contains my code. The repository which contains the scenes and the code that calls my main function can be found [here](https://github.com/tiperiu/COMP371_all/tree/master/COMP371_RaytracerBase/code).
